=========================

## Broken Functionality

- Newly created orders don't calculate total until after it's been opened on a device. Total calculation must be done manually. Haven't been implemented yet.

- Create payment isn't working yet because haven't been able to find a way to load Crypto.PublicKey.RSA into the project.

## Future Feature Implementations

- Better CSS
- Create Item Modifiers
- Create Item Variants
- Other APIs
